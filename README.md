# Summary
This project uses an arduino and servo motor to position a solar panel such that it is always following a source of light. Check out this [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCxZ_Fg01gc&feature=youtu.be) of the solar panel in action.

# Hardware
The circuit schematic used for this project is as follows:

## Equipment used:
- 1 Arduino Uno
- 2 Photodiodes
- 2 1 kiloOhm resistors
- 1 Servo motor

To build the chassis, two platforms of roughly equal size were made: one to contain the solar panel (marked blue) and the other as a base.

Once assembled, the servo motor was inserted through one of the sides and attached to the platform containing the solar panel.
